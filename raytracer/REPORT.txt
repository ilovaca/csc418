REPORT

Members:
	Yeqi Shi 		(shiyeqi)
	Bojian Zheng 	(zhengboj)

Submission:
	The submission is the entire "raytracer" directory, with output images named
	according to the instructions.
	
	On top of original starter files, we have added some texture files, and source
	files for texture mapping.


Implemented Features:
	All required features in part A
	plus,
	Advanced features:
		Path tracing with BRDF
		Non-trivial object: a cylinder
		Anti-aliasing
		Texture Mapping
		Environment Mapping
		Shadows

External Resources:
	Texture images from the internet
	BRDF tutorial found online


Role of Each Member:
  Yeqi is mainly responsible for the overall path tracing algorithm, such as
  anti aliasing, shadows, etc. Bojian is responsible for more detailed features,
  such as texture mapping.
   
	Yeqi Shi implemented the following:
		Phone Shading
		BRDF
		Shadows
		Anti-aliasing

	Bojian Zheng implemented the following:
		Ray-object intersection
		Texture Mapping
		Environment Mapping
		Non-trivial Object
